Use 128 or 256 threads/block:
    512 does not work
    Less than 128 is inefficient

Use ~128 blocks:
    You want to max out the compute cores. It's unclear to me how they're allocated.
    (128,128) seems like a nice sweet spot, but (1024,128) and (1024,256) are also effective

Use local variables (especially curandState_t) IF that piece is likely to be a bottleneck:
    For computing Pi, generating the random numbers is actually the bottleneck,
        since the computations are so simple. For MCMP2 I imagine that the computations
        are the real bottleneck. Maybe try taking the CGBF info local.
